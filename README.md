# OsteoAR
An educational mobile augmented reality application for archaeozoologyv
OsteoAR is an initial prototype of an educational bone atlas designed and developed for the preliminary study "OsteoAR: An educational mobile augmented reality application for an archaeozoological bone atlas." 

The .apk file in this link is currently only for android devices. 

Currently the only available pathway for a full experience is by selecting the right metatarsus of the Bos skeleton.

By using the unity file, you can add more 3D data in this application and make it grow. You can also multiply the scenes in the training mode to create more questions as you like!

We would be delighted to get feedback from you. You can contact us at osteoar@outlook.com for any questions or further comments.
